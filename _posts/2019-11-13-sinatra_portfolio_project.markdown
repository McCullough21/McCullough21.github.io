For my Sinatra project I decided to create a task manager app named “To-Do”.  A user can create an account and keep track of their day to day responsibilities by creating individual tasks with corresponding descriptions.  Once a task is completed they can simply delete it from their list.  The process of creating this application was very enjoyable and enlightening.  

Sinatra is the first framework I have worked in and it was interesting to learn how the different components of the application all work together.  Active Record, SQL, and ORM effectively store and retrieve user data.  Embedded Ruby and HTML create and present the views for the user.  Sessions and Password Protection (bcrypt) provide user security so user’s personal page and information cannot be accessed or manipulated by other users.
