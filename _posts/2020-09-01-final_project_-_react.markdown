For my final project I wanted to make a barbecue application. When quarantine first started I was beside myself trying to figure out what I could do to pass the time.  After the first week I realized that it was a perfect opportunity to finally learn how to make my own barbecue.  This was something that I had been interested in for years.  For these last few months I have really developed a passion for it.

The more research I’ve done, the more it has become clear that barbecue is pretty much open source.   The majority of people share their recipes and cooking tips for everyone to benefit from.   My inspiration for this project came from the hours I spent visiting websites trying to learn new techniques.  I thought it would be better to create a centralized location where people can learn about barbecue and offer their knowledge to others.  This application, “GURU BBQ”, would be a ‘one stop shop’ for barbecue enlightenment.
