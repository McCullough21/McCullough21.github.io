Before I started Flatiron’s Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp, I had never seen code before.  I was always curious about coding but I was never exposed to it.  In my mind coders were “computer geniuses,” and that was outside of my realm.  I was a people person, and my most prominent assets were my interpersonal skills.  Which is the reason that I pursued a career in sales.  Over the years however, I lost interest in sales rolls.  The monetary incentive ceased to be enough of a reward for me.  I needed to find a job that I would enjoy and would keep me engaged.   The one idea that kept popping into my head was coding, but I continually shot it down because I didn’t think I would be able to learn it.  Finally I thought, whats the harm in at least trying to learn a little more about it?  So I picked up the phone and called a friend of mine, who is a software engineer.  I asked them to show me some of their code and explain it to me.  Obviously I didn’t understand the syntax, but logically, I was able to follow along while they explained a function to me; you pass in data to a function which takes that data and performs some task with the data.  As encouraging as it was to be able to comprehend what they were telling me, I was still hesitant toward my ability learn how to code from a baseline of zero.  My friend mentioned that Flatiron had a free prep course which would allow me to start learning some topics and practice writing code.  After spending a few weeks working on the prep course I was convinced that I was going to pursue this new craft.  I began the prep course simply to asses my ability to learn, but quickly realized that, in addition to being able to learn it, I very much enjoyed it.
